This folder contains experiments for producing embeddings to use as input into the VisualBERT model. To run these experiments, executing the `setup.sh` shell script is recommended, so as to install the `detectron2` model. However, these experiments are superseded by the scripts in the `VBExperiments` subfolder. The `VBExperiments` subfolder contains the final method used to generate embeddings, as well as final VisualBERT experiments.
